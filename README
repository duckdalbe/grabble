Grabble
=======

Glueing wget to solr.

Grabble fills the niche of a light-weight and yet not entirely stupid crawler
to keep a solr index up to date.

It utilizes wget to crawl over and fetch content from websites and check for
the availability of documents present in the solr-index. Then the solr-index is
updated and cleaned respectively. Scheduling is left to cron.


Requirements
------------
- ruby >= 1.9 with stdlib
- wget installed and in $PATH
- rsolr >= 1.0.2 (gem)

Features
--------
- Low memory usage.
- Multiple sites.
- Skip files based on pattern or suffix.
- Usable as library.

Todo
----
- Deal with other content-types than text/html and text/plain.
- Nicer displaying of errors.
- Option to not crawl but only push content present in filesystem to solr.

Install
-------
# gem install grabble-0.1.gem

Usage
-----
1. Write a config-file (see ext/grabble.yml).
2. Run grabble: /path/to/bin/grabble [--debug] /path/to/grabble.yml
